Before forming a part in the department of Chalatenango, Dulce Nombre De Maria was part of the San Salvador department since June 12, 1824 to May 22, 1835, and the Cuscatlan department from May 22, 1835 to February 14, 1855.  Dulce Nombre  de Maria has been part of Chalatenango since February 14, 1855. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_Nombre_de_Mar√≠a) <b style="color:white";>Image: Sign of Dulce Nombre de Maria.
